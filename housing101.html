					<p>A Community Land Trust (CLT) is a nonprofit organization that acquires and manages land to provide long-term affordable housing. It separates land ownership from building ownership, ensuring housing remains affordable for future generations by controlling resale prices and prioritizing community stewardship and stability. Properties are typically leased to income-eligible households earning below 120% or 80% AMI.</p>

					<p><b>Disambiguation:</b> Though similar to a land bank in its general mission, a key distinction of CLTs is they hold and lease their property to ensure long-term affordability rather than selling the property right after redevelopment.</p>

						<td><b>30-year loan term</b></td>
						<td>90% of mortgages in the US are 30-year term loans.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Mortgage rates</b></td>
						<td>Mortgage interest rates are a primary driver of affordability: lower rates amplify a household's buying power while higher rates can dramatically reduce it. In April 2024 the typical rate was 6.99%.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Down payment</b></td>
						<td>While a 20% down payment is often considered standard, most households pay less. In Indiana, the average down payment is 12.2% of the purchase price.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>PMI</b></td>
						<td>Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is required by virtually all lenders when the down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price. Rates range widely due to a variety of factors but 0.5% approximates a typical rate.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Property tax</b></td>
						<td>Property tax obligations reduce the amount of household income available for mortgage payments.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Homeowners insurance</b></td>
						<td>Banks require homeowner insurance as part of the financing process.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Utilities</b></td>
						<td>Homeowner costs include the basic utilities required to keep the property heated and operational.</td>

					<p><b>Translating sale price to monthly cost.</b> Even setting aside factors such as interest rates and down payments, changes in home sales prices - especially dramatic increases - can significantly limit households' ability to access the housing options they may need or prefer. First-time homebuyers are especially impacted by rising prices because they lack access to equity in the form of a prior home that they might otherwise be able to sell into the same market and derive extra value from.</p>

				<div class="six columns" style="margin-top: 2%">
					<p>Often referred to as the "national housing crisis," a shortage of units across the country - especially those at prices moderate to low income households can afford - has led to mounting socioeconomic challenges in most communities across the country, including increased homelessness, cost burden, and delayed first time home buying. The housing shortage is the result of a combination of factors, from chronic under production of housing for many years to rapidly escalating construction prices and interest rates.</p>
					<p>As this report reveals, the Michiana region is experiencing its version of the housing shortage in many ways, from under supply of units affordable to low income to a lack of housing options for downsizing seniors.</p>

				<p>A land bank is an entity that acquires, manages, and repurposes vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties to foster neighborhood revitalization, reduce blight, and support economic development and affordable housing initiatives. Land banks may be administered at the municipal level or regionally through collaboration between multiple jurisdictions under a designated managing organization and fiscal sponsor. Land banks are often paired with housing trust funds which help finance construction and other redevelopment activities. Properties are typically sold to income-eligible households earning below 80% AMI.</p>

				<p>Too expensive to qualify for most subsidies but not expensive enough to justify market-rate development, middle-cost housing sometimes falls through the cracks and is under-produced.

				<p>While out-of-state investors have long played a role in local real estate markets, recently some of these entities have begun assembling large portfolios, particularly single family houses that are operated as rental units. In some cases, out-of-state investors may purchase enough units within a single neighborhood to influence housing affordability and driving up local prices, especially among rentals. This trend also tends to transition houses from owner-occupied to renter-occupied, reducing homeownership rates in neighborhoods where investor-owned units are highly concentrated.</p>

Commonly found on platforms like Airbnb and VRBO, these rentals provide temporary lodging for travelers, vacationers, or business visitors, offering an alternative to traditional hotels and long-term leases. However, in some communities, these rental properties can effectively remove units from the local housing inventory, creating competition between rental property investors and households looking for long-term housing.</p>

				<p>Subsidized housing is government-supported housing where low-income tenants pay reduced rent. The difference between tenant payments and market rent is covered by government subsidies. This housing aims to provide affordable living options for individuals and families who cannot afford market-rate housing.</p>
				<p>Subsidies may be provided at all levels of government from federal to state to local and can take many forms, from grants to tax credits to incentives and fee waivers.</p>

				<p>Tax Increment Financing (TIF) dedicates the net-new tax revenue generated by a real estate development toward funding public infrastruture investments that may have been necessary to make the project possible in the first place. Taxes assessed against the original value of the property typically continue to pass through to the municipal coffers but taxes assessed against the additional value derived from the vertical development and other improvements is captured by the TIF for a period of time (often 25 years) before this increment also feeds back to the municipality's general fund.</p>
