				<p>Area Median Income (AMI) is the midpoint of a region's income distribution, meaning half the households earn more and half earn less. It is established for each community by HUD and used to determine eligibility for affordable housing programs and to set income limits for housing assistance in a specific geographic area. "Low-income" housing is typically affordable to households earning below 80% AMI. "Middle-income" refers to 80-120% AMI.</p>

				<p>A Community Land Trust (CLT) is a nonprofit organization that acquires and manages land to provide long-term affordable housing. It separates land ownership from building ownership, ensuring housing remains affordable for future generations by controlling resale prices and prioritizing community stewardship and stability. Properties are typically leased to income-eligible households earning below 120% or 80% AMI.</p>

				<p><b>Disambiguation:</b> Though similar to a land bank in its general mission, a key distinction of CLTs is they hold and lease their property to ensure long-term affordability rather than selling the property right after redevelopment.

						<th>Down payment</th>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>PMI</th>
						<td>Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is required by virtually all lenders when the down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price. Rates range widely due to a variety of factors but 0.5% approximates a typical rate.</td>

				<p><b>Translating sale price to monthly cost.</b> Even setting aside factors such as interest rates and down payments, changes in home sales prices - especially dramatic increases - can significantly limit households' ability to access the housing options they may need or prefer. First-time homebuyers are especially impacted by rising prices because they lack access to equity in the form of a prior home that they might otherwise be able to sell into the same market and derive extra value from. Here is how example sale prices translate into typical monthly costs based on current mortgage rates, down payments, property taxes, utility costs, and related factors in Elkhart County:</p>

				<p>Often referred to as the "national housing crisis," a shortage of units across the country - especially those at prices moderate to low income households can afford - has led to mounting socioeconomic challenges in most communities across the country, including increased homelessness, cost burden, and delayed first time home buying. The housing shortage is the result of a combination of factors, from chronic under production of housing for many years to rapidly escalating construction prices and interest rates.</p>
				<p>As this report reveals, the Michiana region is experiencing its version of the housing shortage in many ways, from under supply of units affordable to low income to a lack of housing options for downsizing seniors.

In some cases, out-of-state investors may purchase enough units within a single neighborhood to influence housing affordability and driving up local prices, especially among rentals. This trend also tends to transition houses from owner-occupied to renter-occupied, reducing homeownership rates in neighborhoods where investor-owned units are highly concentrated.</p>

However, in some communities, these rental properties can effectively remove units from the local housing inventory, creating competition between rental property investors and households looking for long-term housing.

				<p>Tax Increment Financing (TIF) dedicates the net-new tax revenue generated by a real estate development toward funding public infrastruture investments that may have been necessary to make the project possible in the first place. Taxes assessed against the original value of the property typically continue to pass through to the municipal coffers but taxes assessed against the additional value derived from the vertical development and other improvements is captured by the TIF for a period of time (often 25 years) before this increment also feeds back to the municipality's general fund.</p>
