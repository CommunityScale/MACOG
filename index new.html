				<p>At a rate of 0.7 households per job (the prevailing jobs-to-households ratio), these two employers could add nearly 1,900 new households to the region, likely mostly concentrated in St. Joseph County but with some impact in Marshall and Elkhart Counties as well.

The graph at right tracks LIHTC-funded units over the past 15 years and projects likely supply through 2040.

				<h4>Inter-state migration between MACOG and southern Michigan counties</h4>
				<p>As the region’s growth extends into Michigan, there are concerns about losing population and investment out of state.</p>
				<p>Migration trends over the past several years suggest a small degree of net out-migration from St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties to Michigan, an average of 65 households per year. However, the flows are not evenly distributed between Michigan counties. While the region nets an average annual loss of about 125 households to Cass County, MI, the region nets an average annual gain of about 60 households from Barrien County, MI.</p>
				<p>Overall, net out-migration to Michigan does not seem to be a significant problem for the region at present but monitoring these trends is worthwhile in case this changes in the future.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row insight-box">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="six columns">
					<h4>Development costs</h4>
					<p>Especially since the pandemic’s onset, several fundamental development costs have increased substantially, making it more difficult to finance and build housing within price ranges that most can afford. For example, interest rates drive up the cost of construction and permanent loans that typically underwrite the bulk of a development’s budget. Construction materials and labor costs have also risen sharply, adding costs to development projects that can only be passed on to tenants and buyers to a point before becoming too expensive to compete in the market.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="six columns">
					<h4>Infrastructure limitations and costs</h4>
					<p>While most community’s central plants have sufficient capacity to support growth, local sewer and water distribution is often limited to areas that have already been largely built out and extending to new redevelopment districts can be very costly. Though all sides acknowledge sewer and water connections are central to unlocking new development opportunities, there is not always agreement about who can or should fund and implement the needed system extensions. Municipalities and utilities may lack the capital on hand and developers may not be able to justify the expense without compromising a project’s financial feasibility.</p>
				</div>
				
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="six columns">
					<h4>Labor shortage</h4>
					<p>Many developers have reported a lack of construction labor that impedes their ability to meet production goals and keep up with the opportunities in front of them. This includes both licensed and unlicensed trades. For the tradespeople that are available, their costs may be elevated and scheduling difficult given the high demand for their time and skills.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="six columns">
					<h4>Public debate</h4>
					<p>From an analytical perspective, all communities in the region are experiencing some degree of housing shortage or under production relative to local need and projected demand. However, local leaders and residents may not be fully informed and/or on the same page regarding the extent of this challenge or the steps necessary to address it. For example, some may be concerned about the impacts of new development, higher density, rental housing, and other changes on the capacity of local services or the character of the local community despite a general desire for more housing. Resistance to change, disagreement about the nature of the problem, and conflict over the steps to address it can slow or prevent solutions from developing or taking effect.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="six columns">
					<h4>Zoning and regulations</h4>
					<p>Most of the region’s housing was built years or decades ago under different market conditions than exist today. For example, zoning in many neighborhoods reflects a legacy of large homes suitable for families with children on relatively large lots. However, current trends see households shrinking and preferences shifting toward smaller units near amenities and downtowns. The minimum lot sizes, building square footages, and other massing and density parameters in force by local zoning does not always align with the housing typologies and land use patterns today’s households would prefer - especially smaller units on compact lots that would more likely be affordable to middle class households and seniors.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="six columns">
					<h4>Infill challenges</h4>
					<p>Vacant, abandoned, and derelict (VAD) properties are a significant driver of blight and devaluation in many neighborhoods, especially (but not exclusively) in the region’s larger cities. Infill development refers to the process of converting VAD and other underutilized properties into new, quality housing, often with affordability protections. Despite the large number of VAD parcels, there are several hurdles to transforming these sites. For example, significant resources are required to inventory, acquire, remediate, and reposition these sites. Developers have trouble financing small, individual projects (especially when opportunities exist elsewhere for larger, more efficient and profitable projects). Financing resources such as trust funds and land banks and are not widespread.</p>
